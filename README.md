# textsnake_pytorch
Unofficial implementation of textsnake.

Most of the codes are borrowed from [TextSnake.pytorch by princewang1994](https://github.com/princewang1994/TextSnake.pytorch), which is a great repo.

# What is this repo?
This repo breaks down the 1) dataset setup, 2) model setup, 3) training setup, 4) evaluation **mostly for code reading purposes.**

I added some comments in Japanese to get some understanding of how TextSnake works.

`1. Prepare Dataset.ipynb` shows how the annotation data are converted to the TextSnake format step-by-step.

`2. Prepare Model.ipynb` shows how to setup the TextNet model.

`3. Train Model.ipynb` shows how to train the model using the prepared dataset.

`4. Evaluate Model.ipynb` shows how to visualize and evaluate the TextNet results.
